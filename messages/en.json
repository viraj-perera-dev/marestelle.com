    "questions": [
      {
        "question": "Where does the tour depart from?",
        "answer": "From the port of San Domino Island. Once you get off the ferry, our wooden boat is moored on the left."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can the tour start from San Nicola?",
        "answer": "The tour departs from the port of San Domino Island. However, if you prefer to start from San Nicola, we can arrange pickup there, provided you notify us in advance by phone or email. Please inform us at least a few hours beforehand so we can organize it properly."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can we reach the islands to join the tour?",
        "answer": "We depart from the port of San Domino. To reach us, you can book a ferry from Termoli with NLG, from Gargano with Gruppo Armatori Garganici, or a helicopter from Foggia with Alidaunia."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is parking easy at the port of Termoli?",
        "answer": "There is a paid parking area. During high season (July and August), it's advisable to book in advance. You can do so by contacting the port ticket office."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is it allowed to dive from the boat?",
        "answer": "For safety reasons, diving from the boat is not allowed. Boat surfaces can be slippery, especially when wet, increasing the risk of accidental falls, impacts with hard surfaces (like the edge or engine), or unsafe diving spots. Even in seemingly deep waters, hidden obstacles or sudden depth changes can’t be ruled out. Legally and for insurance purposes, any unauthorized diving is the sole responsibility of the diver. Our crew is obliged to enforce all safety measures. To fully enjoy the experience safely, we schedule swim stops in safe locations where guests can enter the water comfortably using the ladder or assisted by the crew, always respecting sea conditions and regulations."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to take off my shoes to get on board?",
        "answer": "Yes, removing shoes before boarding is mandatory. This is for two main reasons: hygiene and respect for shared spaces—the boat is like a home, and keeping it clean ensures comfort for everyone. Shoe soles carry sand, dirt, and debris that can damage surfaces or make them slippery. Safety is also key: going barefoot or using suitable non-slip footwear (like approved nautical socks) helps prevent slips and falls, especially on wet surfaces."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I bring pets on board?",
        "answer": "No, pets are not allowed on board. Our boat is shared with other guests, and to ensure everyone's comfort and well-being, pets are not permitted. This decision is based on hygiene, limited space, potential allergies, and respect for guests who may not feel comfortable around animals. Also, boat trips can be stressful for pets due to heat, noise, movement, and unfamiliar surroundings, making it neither safe nor enjoyable for them."
      },
      {
        "question": "What should I bring on board?",
        "answer": "To make the most of your day at sea, we recommend bringing: swimsuit, sunscreen (preferably eco-friendly), sunglasses, beach towel, snorkel and mask, and water shoes. Space on board is limited, so bring only essentials in a soft, compact bag."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is snorkeling gear provided on board?",
        "answer": "No, snorkeling equipment is not provided on board. For hygienic reasons, we do not supply masks, snorkels, or fins. These are items that come into close contact with the mouth, nose, and face, and even with thorough sanitation, we cannot guarantee the safety standards we aim to offer. Additionally, due to space and logistics, the boat cannot manage personal gear. We recommend bringing your own mask if you wish to snorkel during swim stops. It’s the safest, most comfortable, and sustainable option."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I fish during the boat tour?",
        "answer": "No."

        "title": "Why 'Mare e Stelle'?",
        "description": "Mare e Stelle was born from a simple yet profound idea: letting our guests live every shade of island life — from day to night. The sea is our element. By day it welcomes you with crystal-clear reflections, hidden coves, and the scent of Mediterranean scrub. By night, it becomes silence and poetry — a glowing trail in the dark and a sky full of stars you can only see far from the mainland. With Mare e Stelle, we want to share this sense of wonder — the same we islanders feel every time we sail these waters. To invite you to slow down, listen, observe. To feel part of a place where time doesn’t rush, but is lived. Because here, every moment is precious. And those who look closely, always see more: the sea... and the stars.",

        "title": "Our Wooden Gozzo",
        "description": "Tradition sailing into the present. Today, most tourist boats in the Tremiti Islands are modern fiberglass or inflatable boats. But we chose a different path: to bring back to life a 70-year-old wooden fishing boat, now lovingly restored to offer you an authentic experience — with the charm of the past and the comfort of the present. Getting on board isn’t just starting a tour — it’s stepping into history. In the '60s and '70s, wooden hulls were everywhere here: hand-built by local master carpenters, they were silent companions of workdays. After a long restoration, our gozzo is back navigating these waters, its spirit untouched.",
        "description2": "But there's more. Wood has a soul — something no modern material can match. Sailing on a wooden gozzo is a one-of-a-kind experience. Its heavier hull offers natural stability, perfect even in light waves. We didn’t choose wood out of nostalgia, but out of love. Because how you travel matters as much as the destination. And on this boat, every wave tells a story.",
